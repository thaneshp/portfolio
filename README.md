# My Portfolio Website

This repo contains the files for my portfolio website located on https://thanesh.io. 

I created this website to showcase my skills as well as my personality. It's purpose is to demonstrate my knowledge and help with future employment. I built this site with the help of html5up.net but crafted it to suit my needs. 

## Features
- One-page scroll design.
- Social media icons that link to my profile.
- Navbar that indicates what page you are on as you scroll.
- Project page with sleek mockups and screenshots.
- Listed project tech stack with colourful icons.
- Contact me form that sends me a direct email.
- Responsive design for different screensizes.

## Thought Process
I wanted to create a portfolio that would highlight key information about me, what I've done and ways to contact me.

Prior to creating the site, I determined that I wanted pages that include:
- Home
- About
- Projects
- Blog & Tech Talks
- Contact 

Once I figured out what I wanted to include on this site, I explored theme options which I could resonate with. Essentially, I wanted to make a site which was easy-to-use and enables others to quickly scan through.
